Given control points of B-spline. These points move within the screen animating the spline.

B-spline is transforming into composite Bezier curve with de Boor algorithm. Bezier curves are interpolated with de Casteljau algorithm.

Features:

* Adding and deletion of control points.
* Changing quality of interpolation by de Casteljau algorithm.
* Switching antialiasing.
* Changing speed of animation.
* Switching visible points and lines.
